                    <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                    <p>The largest living land animals are the elephants. They are noted for their long trunk, which is an elongated upper
                    lip and nose. They have column like legs and a huge head with wide, flat ears. Mammals of Africa and Asia, elephants live
                    in habitats ranging from thick rainforests to savannas. In addition, elephants are one of the longest-lived animals with 
                    an average lifespan of around 5-70 years. But, the oldest elephant to ever live passed away at the age of 86 years.
                    Furthermore, they mostly inhabit jungles but humans have forced them to work in zoos and circuses. 
                    Elephants are considered to be one of the most intelligent animals. Similarly, they are quite obedient too. Usually, the 
                    female elephants live in groups but the male ones prefer solitary living. Additionally, this wild animal has great learning 
                    capacity. Humans use them for transport and entertainment purposes. Elephants are of great importance to the earth and mankind. 
                    Thus, we must protect them to not create an imbalance in nature's cycle.</p>

                    <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                    <p>Giraffes are the world's tallest mammals, thanks to their towering legs and long necks. A giraffe's legs alone are taller 
                    than many humans—about 6 ft. These long legs allow giraffes to run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances and cruise 
                    comfortably at 10 miles an hour over longer distances. People are the major predator of giraffes. They hunt giraffes for meat, 
                    hair, and tails. It is believed that the giraffe tail brings happiness. Lions and tigers are also spotted with several 
                    giraffe predators.Giraffes have a sense of smell, vision, and fantastic eyesight. The life expectancy of a giraffe is up to 
                    twenty- six years in the wild and thirty- six years in captivity. Giraffes live in deserts and open forests.  They are many 
                    available to the south in the Sahara, and large numbers only in East Africa. Giraffes are herbivores. They eat mainly on the 
                    leaves of acacia, mimosa and wild apricots.</p>

                    <h3>RHINOCEROS</h3>
                    <p>Rhinoceros, massive hoofed mammal of Africa, India, and SE Asia, characterized by a snout with one or two horns. The rhinoceros 
                    family, along with the horse and tapir families, forms the order of odd-toed hoofed mammals. The five living species, which once 
                    ranged widely across Africa and Asia, now consist of remnant populations in protected or remote areas. All are listed as endangered, 
                    with the exception of one subspecies of the white rhinoceros. They are herbivores that means they eat only plants and fruits. Few animals 
                    like African and Asian Elephants are taller at the shoulder than the rhinoceros. The species of rhinoceros are Indian rhinoceros, white 
                    rhinoceros, black rhinoceros, and many more species. The white and black rhinoceros are found in Africa while the Indian, the Javan, and 
                    the Sumatran rhinoceros are found in the Asian region.</p>

                    <h3>APE</h3>
                    <p>Apes are found in the tropical forests of western and central Africa and Southeast Asia. Apes are distinguished from monkeys by the 
                    complete absence of a tail and the presence of an appendix and by their more complex brains. The gorilla, chimpanzee, bonobo, and 
                    orangutan are called great apes in recognition of their comparatively large size and humanlike features; the gibbons are called 
                    lesser apes. The great apes are much more intelligent than monkeys and gibbons. Great apes, for example, are able to recognize 
                    themselves in mirrors (monkeys and other nonhumans cannot, with the exception of bottlenose dolphins). They can also reason abstractly, 
                    learn quasi-linguistic communication, at least when taught by humans, and learn in captivity to make simple tools
                    (though some populations of orangutans and chimpanzees make tools in the wild). </p>

                    <p>Deer, (family Cervidae), any of 43 species of hoofed ruminants in the order Artiodactyla, notable for having two large and 
                    two small hooves on each foot and also for having antlers in the males of most species and in the females of one species. Deer 
                    are native to all continents except Australia and Antarctica, and many species have been widely introduced beyond their 
                    original habitats as game animals. One species, the reindeer (also known as the caribou), has been domesticated.Some swamp and 
                    island species are endangered, but most continental species are flourishing under protection and good management.</p>

                    Instead, ostriches are great runners and are able to reach speeds of up to 43 miles per hour. One stride can be 10 to 16 feet long. 
                    They have long, strong legs with two clawed toes, allowing them to reach these high speeds. </p>

                    Feeds nocturnally for fish, frogs and other prey. Where it overlaps with Yellow-crowned Night-Heron, note large teardrop-shaped 
                    white spots on wing coverts which Yellow-crowned lacks.</p>

                    <p>A large stork with a long yellow bill that curves down at the tip, like that of an Ibis. Adult is primarily white with black 
                    striped markings on the wings and bright pink on tertials. Also note the bright orange face, pinkish legs, and speckled band across 
                    the chest. Immatures are duller, with a brown wash, and lack the chest band. These storks typically fly with their head and neck 
                    drooping almost at or below the belly level. Often seen near water bodies such as wetlands, marshes, and flooded agricultural fields. 
                    Breeds in crowded colonies, often with other waterbirds.</p>

                    <p>Cormorants also known as shags are a family of aquatic birds. There are about 40 different species of cormorants. They are distributed 
                    worldwide, with the largest diversity in tropical and temperate zones. Cormorants inhabit marine and inland waters. They are found along
                    marine coastlines of continents and islands. Inland populations inhabit lakes, open swamps and marshes, and rivers. They live up to a maximum 
                    of about 25 years. </p>

                    <p>Macaws' big size and vibrant colors make them hard to overlook. These social birds can create a racket when they feel so inclined, 
                    and their clownish ways are sure to draw attention. Although their large beaks can be intimidating, a well-socialized macaw can be a 
                    friendly and affectionate companion. Macaws are known as the giants of the parrot world. The hyacinth macaw is the longest parrot, with 
                    a head to tail length of nearly 40 inches. </p>

                    It is native to freshwater habitats from southern Iran to the Indian subcontinent, where it inhabits marshes, lakes, rivers and 
                    artificial ponds. The mugger crocodile is a powerful swimmer that uses its tail and hind feet to move forward, change direction and 
                    submerge. It belly-walks, with its belly touching ground, at the bottom of waterbodies and on land.</p>

                    Fortunately for most sea-dwellers—and us!—their favorite meal is plankton. They scoop these tiny plants and animals up, along with 
                    any small fish that happen to be around, with their colossal gaping mouths while swimming close to the water's surface.</p>
