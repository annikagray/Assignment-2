                <h2><strong>ABOUT SRI LANKA</strong></h2>
                <p>Formerly known as Ceylon, and officially the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, is an island country in South Asia. 
                It lies in the Indian Ocean, southwest of the Bay of Bengal, and southeast of the Arabian Sea; it is separated from the Indian 
                subcontinent by the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Strait. Sri Lanka shares a maritime border with India and the Maldives. Sri 
                Jayewardenepura Kotte is its legislative capital, and Colombo is its largest city and financial center. Today, Sri Lanka is a 
                multinational state, home to diverse cultures, languages, and ethnicities. The Sinhalese are the majority of the nation's 
                population. The Tamils, who are a large minority group, have also played an influential role in the island's history. Other 
                long-established groups include the Moors, the Burghers, the Malays, the Chinese, and the indigenous Vedda.</p>

                <h2><strong>PLANTS</strong></h2>
                <p>The basic purpose for the maintenance of these gardens was beauty, aesthetic sense and the calm and quite environment 
                which a secluded place full of greenery and colourful flowers provide. With the advent of the era of scientific development 
                most of botanical garden started keeping interesting exotic plants for the purpose of exhibition and education. A number of 
                botanical gardens become institutions of scientific research and undertook the job of cataloguing and classification of plants. 
                Many of them have contributed significantly to our knowledge of taxonomy and systematic of plant life.</p>
