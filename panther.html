            <div><h2><u><b>Classification and evolution</b></u></h2><br>
                The Panther (also commonly known as the Black Panther) is a large member of the Big Cat family, native to Asia, Africa and the 
                Americas. The Panther is not a distinct species itself but is the general name used to refer to any black coloured feline of the 
                Big Cat family, most notably Leopards and Jaguars. The Panther is an elusive and powerful animal that has adapted well to a 
                variety of habitats around the world, and is known to be one of the strongest climbers of all felines. Although the Panther is not
                technically classified as a separate species, they are considered to be endangered by many due to the declining numbers of both 
                Leopards and Jaguars throughout much of their natural ranges.
            </div>
            <div><h2><u><b>Distribution and habitat</b></u></h2><br>
                Panthers are animals that are natively found on three of the world's continents, with their location depending on whether or 
                not it is a black Leopard or a Black Jaguar. There are 30 different subspecies of Leopard found across both Asia and sub-Saharan 
                Africa, and with the once large natural range of the Jaguar stretching throughout Central and South America and even into parts 
                of the USA, the Panther has become an incredibly adaptable animal that is found in a variety of different habitats. Although they 
                are most commonly found in tropical and deciduous forests, the Panther can also be found inhabiting both marsh and swampland, 
                along with grasslands and even more hostile areas such as deserts and mountains. Along with a number of the world's largest 
                felines, the Panther is becoming rarer in the wild primarily due to habitat loss in the form of deforestation.
            </div>
            <div><h2><u><b>Diet and prey</b></u></h2><br>
                The Panther is a carnivorous animal and one of the most feared and powerful predators throughout its natural environment. Hunting 
                under the cover of night, the Panther's dark fur makes it almost impossible to spot meaning that it can move through the jungle 
                completely unseen. Although the majority of their hunting is actually done on the ground, they are also known to hunt from trees meaning 
                that they can ambush their prey from above. The exact diet of the Panther is dependent on where in the world it lives although medium to 
                large sized herbivores comprise the bulk of the diet of many large Cats. Animals including Deer, Warthogs, Wild Boar, Tapir and Antelope 
                are all hunted by Panthers, along with smaller species like Birds and Rabbits when larger prey is scarce.
